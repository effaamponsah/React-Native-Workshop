# Building Mobile App UI's with React Native

In this workshop we will explore building mobile application user interfaces with React Native. React Native makes it easy to write applications using React and its concepts. It can both be integrated into an existing native(Xcode or Android Studio) project or it can be used to start a brand new project.

We will focus on creating a new project with React Native and to reduce the complexity as possible so we can all catch along, we will be using [Expo](https://expo.io).

This workshop is a mixture of hands on exercises and taught mini sessions to introduce the concepts behind building quality mobile UI's with React Native.

All progress to the app will be kept [here](https://github.com/effaamponsah/Turntabl-React-Native-Course). So feel free to check it out and fork it to have your personal copy of it.

## Setting up development environment

Please install the following programs or dependencies to ensure a smooth usage with React Native

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Expo cli](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)
- Exp mobile application. Get this from your playstores(if you prefer to use a physical device)
